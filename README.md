# BioBert_Annotations

This project was set up with python 3.11.9 and Visual Studio. These will need to be installed for this guide to work.

## Setting up the environment
When Python and Visual Studio Code are installed, we will need to set up a python environment and install the libraries we will use.
In Visual Studio Code, open the folder that contains repository.
In the terminal (Str+รถ or View/Terminal) type python -m venv .venv

This sets up the python environment.

After that, install the necesary libraries by typeing pip install -r requirements.txt in the terminal.
