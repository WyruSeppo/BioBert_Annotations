# BioBert_Annotations

This project was set up with python 3.11.9 and Visual Studio. These will need to be installed for this guide to work.
When this project was started in November 2024, python version 3.11.9 was chosen due to compatibility issues. Depending on the date, these issues might have been resolved.

## Setting up the environment
When Python and Visual Studio Code are installed, we will need to set up a python environment and install the libraries we will use.
In Visual Studio Code, open the folder that contains repository.
In the terminal (Str+รถ or View/Terminal) type ``` python -m venv .venv ```

This sets up the python environment.

After that, install the necesary libraries by typeing ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ``` in the terminal.
