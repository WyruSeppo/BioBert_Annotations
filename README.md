# BioBert_Annotations

This project was set up with python 3.11.9 and Visual Studio and these will need to be installed for this guide to work.

## Setting up the environment
When Python and Visual Studio are installed, we will need to set up a python environment and install the libraries we will use.\

When you clone your repository, you can set up the python environment by running python -m venv .venv

, activating the environment, and using pip install -r requirements.txt.
This will install the necesarry frameworks/libraries for this project.
