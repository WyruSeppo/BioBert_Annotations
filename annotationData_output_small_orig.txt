Furthermore,Ta0583 co-crystallised with ADP shows that the nucleotide binds at the interface between the subdomains of Ta0583 in a manner similar to that of actin.

None	PF10070	Q81NL0	None	None	WP_000026985.1	None	None	DABA_BACAN	None	None	This entry represents the probable inorganic carbon transporter subunit DabA, which is part of an energy-coupled inorganic carbon pump together with DabB subunit in DAB operons (DAB1 and DAB2), found in a wide range of bacteria and archaea. Members of this family were previously known as UPF0753. DAB operon is required for CO2 concentrating mechanisms [[cite:PUB00093673]]. The substrate of this subunit may be CO2 rather than carbonate ions based on kinetic calculations and in experimental assays in which E.coli was deleted of its carbonic anhydrase genes and expression of DAB2 operon restores its growth. Structural homology modelling suggests that DabA contains a domain that is distantly homologous to a type II beta-carbonic anhydrase (CA).	Expression of both dabA and dabB (DA2) restores growth inCC       ambient air to E.coli deleted of its carbonic anhydrase genes (calledCC       CAfree, deletion of 'can' and 'cynT'). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:31406332}.
